# Android Source Scout
Android Security Static Analysis Tool for Android Studio performs static analysis of Android source code to detect security vulnerabilities. Detecting security vulnerabilities as they are written greatly decreases the cost to fix them. Additionally, educating developers about the safe way to write code has many additional benefits.

# Accuracy
Some additional security mechanisms have been introduced in Android since this was written, so it is important to keep up with these changes to eliminate all false positives. Additionally, the checks are not perfect, so it is important to use this as a helpful tool, but not rely too heavily on it for security.

# Installation
SourceScout installs as a plugin for Android Studio.

## Install Plugin
Within Android Studio, choose `File`->`Settings`->`Plugins`, then select Select `Install Plugin from Disk` and select the downloaded jar.

## Begin Finding Vulnerabilities
The setup is now complete. You will likely see the highest density of issues in the AndroidManifest.xml. You can also view a list of all identified issues by choosing Analyze->Inspect Codeâ€¦ and the issues will be listed under Android Security Issues.
